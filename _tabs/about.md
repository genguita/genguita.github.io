Hello! I am Guillermo Enguita Lahoz (he/him) a computer scientist from Zaragoza (Spain) graduated from Universidad of Zaragoza (who could have guessed), where I also got a Master's in Robotics, Graphics and Computer Vision. 
I am mostly interested in all things related to computer graphics, from physically based to real time rendering, as well as general GPU programming and high performance computing.

In my free time I enjoy listening to music, mostly going to live shows and anything related to the Spanish independent scene. Besides, I am learning to play the piano, and I also love video games as a medium.
