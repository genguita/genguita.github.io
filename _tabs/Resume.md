## Experience
---

### Research Engineer @ Graphics & Imaging Lab
*Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain*  
*January 2024 – February 2026*

---

Hired by the ENLIGHTEN european project, focused on transient imaging applications that leverage the propagation of light through time. My responsibilities included:
- Implementation of physically based rendering and imaging algorithms.
- Study of the quality of existing transient imaging algorithms in Infrared light ranges.
- Application of the polarization of light in transient imaging algorithms.
- Design and evaluation of experiments, technical writing of reports, publications and dissemination work.
- Collaboration with international colleagues, through email, video conference and occasional visits.


### Academic research intership @ Graphics & Imaging Lab
*Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain*  
*February 2023 – September 2023*

---

- Analysis of machine learning techniques for automatic action detection in video sequences.
- Worked on dataset processing, feature extraction, and fine-tuning of previous models.

### Open source contributions
---

Contributor to the [mitransient](https://github.com/diegoroyo/mitransient) and [tal](https://github.com/diegoroyo/tal) libraries, developed by students in the Graphics & Imaging Lab, used for transient rendering applications that take into account the propagation of light in time. My main tasks included:

- Reimplementation of a transient rendering algorithm, obtaining a speed increase up to two orders of magnitude.
- Implementation of a realistic sensor model, allowing users to simulate noise and artifacts seen in real hardware.
- Helped with the implementation of polarized transient rendering and implemented its visualization.
- Helped with bug fixing, documentation and creation of tutorials.
- Offered support to users of the libraries, helping with installation, usage doubts and trouble-shooting.
