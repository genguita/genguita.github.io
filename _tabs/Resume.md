## Experience
---

### Research Engineer @ Graphics & Imaging Lab
*Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain*  
*January 2024 – February 2026*  
*Supervised by [prof. Albert Redó](https://redo-sanchez.github.io/) and [prof. Diego Gutiérrez](https://giga.cps.unizar.es/~diegog/)*

I was hired by the ENLIGHTEN european project, focused on non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, which allows to see around corners by leveraging the time-of-flight of light. Knowing how light propagates through time, NLOS algorithms can reconstruct the appearance of objects by analyzing how indirect light bounces in a relay surface.
My main responsabilities in this role incuded:
- Implementation of physically based rendering and imaging algorithms, taking into account complex material properties and how they interact with light's time-of-flight.
- Study of the quality of existing visible light NLOS imaging algorithms in the near Infrared, proving their aplicability in this range. These findings open the door to eye-safe NLOS prototypes.
- Study of the connection between the time-of-flight of light and its polarization, as well as how to apply it to imaging algorithms, and how to process transient-polarized signals.
- Design and evaluation of experiments, technical writing of reports, publications and dissemination work.
- Collaboration with international colleagues, through email, video conference and occasional visits.


### Academic research intership @ Graphics & Imaging Lab
*Universidad de Zaragoza (in collaboration with BSH), Spain*  
*February 2023 – September 2023*  
*Supervised by [prof. Ana Serrano](https://ana-serrano.github.io/) and [prof. Diego Gutiérrez](https://giga.cps.unizar.es/~diegog/)*

As part of my undegrad, I spent 7 months as an intern in the Graphics & Imaging lab, working in a collaboration project with BSH, which aims to integrate machine learning advances into the kitchen. In particular, my intership was focused in automatic action detection during the cooking process. My main tasks included.

- Analysis of different machine learning techniques for automatic action detection in cooking video sequences, mainly video transformers and other attention-based models.
- Worked on the processing of an in-house dataset, as well as feature extraction for model training, and fine-tuning and modification of previous models to better fit them to said dataset.

### Open source contributions
---

I am a contributor to the [mitransient](https://github.com/diegoroyo/mitransient) and [y-tal](https://github.com/diegoroyo/tal) libraries, developed by students in the Graphics & Imaging Lab. These libraries provide a wrapper over the Mitsuba 3 framework, allowing for the simulation of transient light transport, as well as providing tools for NLOS simulation and reconstruction. Some of my contributions include:

- Reimplementation of a transient rendering algorithm, obtaining a speed increase up to two orders of magnitude.
- Implementation of a realistic sensor model, allowing users to simulate noise and artifacts seen in real hardware.
- Helped with the implementation of polarized transient rendering and implemented its visualization.
- Helped with bug fixing, documentation and creation of tutorials.
- Offered support to users of the libraries, helping with installation, usage doubts and trouble-shooting.
